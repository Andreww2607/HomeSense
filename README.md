# HomeSense


HomeSense is an open source Home automation system. The main goal of this project is to enable you to build a simple, intuitive, user-friendly system that would require minimum coding time and low-cost hardware.

Any raspberry-pi compatible nodes will work, but details about our specific hardware configuration will be available.

This is a list of what we are going for in this project:
